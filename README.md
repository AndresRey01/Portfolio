# My Portfolio

This is as website to my personal portfolio that will eventually be updated with multiple projects! This portfolio will continue to be updated throughout the process of my bootcamp and projects.

# What was done

Portfolio website created from scratch were employers can view projects and websites I have completed.

- Html and CSS were the main languages for this project
- I used various techniques I had learned to make sure this page was properly set up
